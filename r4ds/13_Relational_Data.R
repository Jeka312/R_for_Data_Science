flights2 %>% 
  select(-origin, -dest) %>%

# 13.4.1 Understanding joins
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x, 
  1, "x1",
  2, "x2", 
  3, "x3"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
  1, "y1",
  2, "y2", 
  4, "y3"
)
# 13.4.2 Inner join
# An inner join matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal
x %>% 
  inner_join(y, by = "key")
# The most important property of an inner join is that unmatched rows are not included in the result. 

# 13.4.3 Outer joins
# An inner join keeps observations that appear in both tables. 
# An outer join keeps observations that appear in at least one of the tables. 
# There are three types of outer joins:
# A left join keeps all observations in x.
# A right join keeps all observations in y.
# A full join keeps all observations in x and y.

#13.4.4 Duplicate keys
# One table has duplicate keys
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
  1, "x1",
  2, "x2",
  2, "x3", 
  1, "x4"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
  1, "y1",
  2, "y2"
)
left_join(x, y, by = 'key')
# Both tables have duplicate keys. This is usually an error because in neither
# table do the keys uniquely identify an observation. When you join duplicated
# keys, you get all possible combinations, the Cartesian product:
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
  1, "x1",
  2, "x2",
  2, "x3",
  3, "x4"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
  1, "y1",
  2, "y2",
  2, "y3",
  3, "y4"
)
left_join(x, y, by = "key")

# 13.4.5 Defining the key columns You can use other values for by to connect the
# tables in other ways: The default, by = NULL, uses all variables that appear
# in both tables, the so called natural join. For example, the flights and
# weather tables match on their common variables: year, month, day, hour and
# origin.
flights2 %>% 
  left_join(weather)
# A character vector, by = "x". This is like a natural join, but uses only some
# of the common variables. For example, flights and planes have year variables,
# but they mean different things so we only want to join by tailnum.
flights2 %>% 
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")
# A named character vector: by = c("a" = "b"). This will match variable a in
# table x to variable b in table y. The variables from x will be used in the
# output.
